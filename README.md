# Astronomy to Astrology

Project on taking 3 datasets from the web to create an interactive program that gives astrological information on the planets that are present in the user's city at the time of querying.


## Installation



```bash
1. Download this project into a folder along with the four static datasets: 'worldcities.csv', '5_cities.json', 'planet_info.json', final_project.db'.
2. Run the project from the terminal and interact with the program
3. To run the project in static mode, type '--static' after the filename
```
    
## FAQ

#### Q1: How do I run the program?

    Answer 1: Run from your terminal. You can run it in default mode or a static dataset mode by adding '--static'.

#### Q2: How do I interact with the program?

    Answer 2: You input the parameters that you are interested in. The program will specify what the input should be/look like.

#### Q3: How do I end the program?

    Answer 3: You can terminate the program whenever you want to. You can answer 'no' when the program asks 'Would you like to know about a different planet?,' or if you inquire about every single planet on the list, the program will automatically terminate.
